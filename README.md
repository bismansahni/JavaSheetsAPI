This is a project that I have created using Java Api for google sheets which for now, retrieves the target google sheet and prints in the terminal.
I have implemented an OAuth which enables to login to the account, to retrieve google sheets.
In the main java file, change, the spreadsheet id to your id.
The project utilizes gradle for easy dependency inclusion, so it will be a bit easier if you have gradle installed.

In the src/main/java/resources/credentials.json add the api keys from your google account.
